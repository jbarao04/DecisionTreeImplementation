# DecisionTreeImplementation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier in Python. Decision Trees are popular supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks due to their interpretability and simplicity. This project provides a clear, step-by-step guide on training a Decision Tree model, visualizing its structure, and evaluating its performance on a sample dataset.
